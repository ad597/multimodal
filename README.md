# NeuroForge

A high-performance compute framework for multimodal AI and large-scale reinforcement learning simulations.

## Overview

NeuroForge provides optimized GPU kernels and distributed simulation environments for training thousands of AI agents simultaneously. The framework combines custom CUDA implementations with efficient batch processing to achieve significant performance improvements over standard libraries.

## Features

- **Custom GPU Kernels**: Optimized attention mechanisms for vision-language models
- **Large-Scale Simulation**: Support for 10,000+ parallel agents
- **Distributed Training**: Multi-GPU and multi-process training capabilities
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized batch processing and resource management
- **PyTorch Integration**: Seamless compatibility with existing PyTorch workflows

## Performance

- 5-10x speedup on attention operations vs standard PyTorch
- Handles 10,000+ agents in real-time simulation
- Memory-efficient processing for large-scale training
- Distributed training across multiple GPUs/processes

## Installation

```bash
cd neuroforge
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Simulation

```python
from neuroforge.simulation import DistributedSimulation, SimulationConfig

config = SimulationConfig(num_agents=1000)
simulation = DistributedSimulation(config)

observations = simulation.reset()
for step in range(1000):
    actions = get_actions(observations)  # Your policy
    observations, rewards, dones, info = simulation.step(actions)
```

### Training Agents

```python
from neuroforge.simulation import DistributedTrainer, TrainingConfig

config = TrainingConfig(num_agents=1000, max_steps=100000)
trainer = DistributedTrainer(config)

summary = trainer.train(max_updates=100)
```

### Running Demos

```bash
python neuroforge/examples/multimodal_demo.py
